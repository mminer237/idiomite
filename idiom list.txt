a bark doesn't make a wound
a bitter pill to swallow
a dime a dozen
a hot potato
a sandwich short of a picnic
ace in the hole
Achilles' heel
all ears
all thumbs
an arm and a leg
apple of discord
around the clock
at the drop of a hat
back to the drawing board
back to the grindstone
ball is in his court
balls to the wall
barking up the wrong tree
basket case
beating a dead horse
beat around the bush
bed of roses
the bee's knees
best of both worlds
bird brain
bite off more than one can chew
bite the bullet
bite the dust
bought the farm
break a leg
burn the midnight oil
bust one's chops
by the seat of one's pants
by the skin of one's teeth
call a spade a spade
call it a day
catch the end of the thread
champ at the bit
cheap as chips
chew the cud
chew the fat
chink in one's armor
clam up
clutch one's pearls
cold shoulder
couch potato
cool your jets
crocodile tears
cut off your nose to spite your face
cut a rug
cut the cheese
cut the mustard
dig one's heels in
don't count chickens before they hatch
don't have a cow
drop a dime
elephant in the room
eleventh hour
fall off the turnip truck
feel the band around his head
fish out of water
fit as a fiddle
for a song
fly in the ointment
fly on the wall
from A to Z
from scratch
get bent out of shape
get a wiggle on
get one's ducks in a row
get one's knickers in a twist
get your goat
gone south
grab the bull by the horns
grasp the nettle
have a blast
have all your Christmases come at once
have eyes bigger than one's stomach
have eyes in the back of one's head
head over heels
heard it through the grapevine
hit the ceiling
hit the nail on the head
hit the road
hit the sack
hit the spot
hold all the cards
hold your horses
hook, line, and sinker
in over one's head
in the last drop
jump ship
jump the gun
kick the bucket
kick the habit
kill two birds with one stone
let the cat out of the bag
like pulling hens' teeth
like turkeys voting for Christmas
lit up like a Christmas tree
look a gift horse in the mouth
loose cannon
method to one's madness
my two cents
never put an apple in your rabbit
nip it in the bud
no dog in this fight
not oneâ€™s cup of tea
off one's rocker
off the hook
once in a blue moon
own goal
part and parcel
pop one's clogs
the pot calling the kettle black
piece of cake
preaching to the choir
pull oneself together
pull somebody's leg
push the envelope
pushing up daisies
put a spoke in one's wheel
put on airs
put the cat among the pigeons
raining cats and dogs
right as rain
rock the boat
run with your head as a third leg
shoot the breeze
shooting fish in a barrel
sleep with the fishes
speak of the devil
spill the beans
spin one's wheels
stay in one's lane
steal someone's thunder
step up to the plate
stick out like a sore thumb
straw that broke the camel's back
take a shine
take the biscuit
take the cake
take with a grain of salt
there's a dog buried there
throw stones in glass houses
throw the baby out with the bathwater
throw under the bus
through thick and thin
thumb one's nose
tie one on
trip the light fantastic
two a penny
under my thumb
under the weather
the whole nine yards
wild goose chase
wolf something down
work for the axe
yesterday's grouse's son
you can say that again
you can't step twice in the same river
