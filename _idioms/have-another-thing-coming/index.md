To have another thing coming is to be mistaken about the future. It is typically used as warning to someone who is overly confident or arrogant. One may expect one thing to happen, but in reality, he will have another thing coming to pass. Often this incorrect expectation is restated in the rebukeâ€”"You think you're going to win? You have another thing coming!"

Its origin is actually a mishearing of the phrase "[have another think coming](/idioms/have-another-think-coming/)." The original phrase is a more humorous way of telling someone to reconsider their opinion instead of a statement directly about the results, but in practice, they mean exactly the same thing. Although both seem to have originated in the United States, the phrase "have another thing coming" has become dominant there, while the original phrase is more common in the rest of the world.
