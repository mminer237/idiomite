Saying someone has another think coming is a somewhat clever way of saying he is wrong about his expectations. He thinks one thingâ€”but in time his expectations will be dashed, and he will have to think about it again. It is typically used as a warning to someone who is overly confident or arrogant, often with the perceived delusion restated in the rebuke: "You think you're going to win? You have another think coming!"

Given the phrase's bit of humor, it can be a light way of telling someone his plans are not going to work out. However, it typically is quite a confrontational phrase, and it is often used in a more serious context.

In the United States, the variation "[have another thing coming](/idioms/have-another-thing-coming/)" is more common. The two phrases mean exactly the same thing however.
