To kill two birds with one stone means to accomplish two separate goals with one plan or action. Some theoretical examples would be:

* You need to go into town for business, but that enables you to pick up dinner in the area on the way back.
* You get your daughter a cat she's been wanting, while also using it to eliminate a mouse infestation.
* You fly out to Florida to attend a wedding, but take an extra couple of days off to have a mini vacation.
* You cut down a dead tree threatening your house, and get the firewood you need.
* You bike to work, saving gas while losing weight.
* You go to the mall and get a haircut, buy clothes, get a massage, and buy a new dishwasher all in one trip.

It's when you do something you need to do and can accomplish a second goal with little extra effort. The objectives coincidentally align. That's not to say that it couldn't have been plannedâ€”situations rarely work out so well without a little foresight, but it is not noteworthy when the objectives are naturally linked.

The idea is of a man hunting birds with a sling. Usually he would only be able to kill one bird per stone. However, if he were able to line up two birds, he could theoretically kill both with a single stone and save time and ammunition. It is a metaphor for efficiency.
